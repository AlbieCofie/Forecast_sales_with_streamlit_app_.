## Forecasting Future Sales: A Predictive Analysis of Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery

A key factor in a company's retail performance is the ability to properly estimate sales and manage inventories. The key problem is predicting the sales and inventory requirements for each location to avoid overstocking and understocking, allowing the business to offer the greatest customer service while reducing losses and guaranteeing the store's sustainability.

In this research, we the Monaco group plan to utilize sevaral time series forecasting method to forecast store sales for the Ecuadorian grocery retailer Corporation Favorita. Dates, stores, product details, whether the item was on sale, and sales statistics are all included in the training data. Separate files are also provided with further information that could be helpful in developing the models.
